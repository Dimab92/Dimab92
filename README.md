## Virtualization | Bash and Bash Scripting:
Hypervisors: Experience with VirtualBox â€” installation, configuration, and management of virtual machines.

Installed and configured UNIX-based OS in a virtualized environment.

Performed system updates and package upgrades using the command line.

Set up and configured essential tools required for server functionality.

Wrote Bash scripts to automate routine tasks like backups, version tracking, and repository management 

## Docker and Containerization:
Wrote a Dockerfile to run the backup script inside a container

Used Docker volumes to keep backup files safe and outside the container

Used environment variables to protect sensitive data

Backups are saved to the host system so they are not lost when the container stops

## Docker Compose:
Created Dockerfiles for backend and frontend applications
Built multi-container architecture using Docker Compose

Configured services for:

Backend API

Frontend app

PostgreSQL database

Nginx as reverse proxy

Wrote Nginx config to route requests between frontend and backend
Used environment variables to manage settings across services
Connected services using Docker networks
Mapped ports to access the app in browser

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
Created pipelines for backend, frontend, nginx, and backup using GitHub Actions

For each component:

Wrote separate workflows triggered by code changes (push/PR to specific folders)

Used workflow_dispatch to allow manual launch with choice of runner

Configured support for both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners

Added custom names and dropdown menu for clarity and flexibility

Backend pipeline:

Linting with ruff

Running tests with python manage.py test and env variables

Building Docker image with two tags: latest and short Git SHA

Saving Docker image as artifact (1-day retention)

Frontend pipeline:

Linting with npm run lint

Testing with npm run test

Building Docker image tagged latest

Saving image as artifact (1-day retention)

Nginx pipeline:

Building Docker image with latest and short Git SHA tags

Saving image as artifact (1-day retention)

Backup pipeline:

Running backup.sh script

Checking versions.json from previous artifact and appending data

Saving both backup archive and updated versions.json as separate artifacts (5-day retention)

## Cloud & AWS Services:
Configured and secured cloud infrastructure using AWS Console and GitHub Actions

IAM & User Management:

Created and configured IAM users with read-only permissions for multiple team members

Used least privilege principle to assign roles and permissions

Compute (EC2):

Deployed a Virtual Machine (EC2) instance with Elastic IP

Attached custom IAM role to allow secure ECR access

Container Registry (ECR):

Created and configured a private ECR registry

Built secure GitHub Actions pipeline to push Docker images to ECR using minimal IAM permissions

Storage (S3):

Created an S3 bucket named devops-intern-$GITHUB_USERNAME

Modified backup.sh pipeline to:

Download versions.json from S3

Update backup metadata

Upload updated versions.json and archive to S3

CI/CD Integration with GitHub:

Connected GitHub to AWS using OIDC (OpenID Connect) for secure, token-based access (no secrets exposed)

Integrated AWS services into CI/CD pipeline using environment-specific roles

## Cloud Deployment & Automation:
Automated the full deployment pipeline from GitHub to cloud VM using Docker and GitHub Actions.

Docker Compose (Production):

Created docker-compose-prod.yaml to deploy production-ready services (Nginx, Backend, Frontend) using prebuilt images from private container registry

Ensured separation of development and production environments

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform:
Provisioned production-grade infrastructure on AWS using Terraform with focus on scalability, automation, and cost-efficiency (Free Tier).

### Key Components Deployed:

ECS Cluster: Created ECS cluster terraform-ecs-cluster-$GITHUB_USERNAME with EC2 capacity provider and autoscaling group (bootstrapped via user data)

Containerized Task Definition: Deployed multi-container task with:

Frontend

Backend

Nginx

PostgreSQL database

Security Groups: Designed using least-privilege principle

Application Load Balancer (ALB): Configured listener rules and health checks for seamless routing to ECS tasks

### State Management:

Stored Terraform state in S3

Enabled state locking with DynamoDB for safe team collaboration

### CI/CD Integration:

Integrated GitHub Actions to:

Trigger deployment on push to main or workflow_dispatch

Push Docker images to ECR

Update ECS task and service without downtime

Retained workflow naming for consistent automation control

### Best Practices:

Defined Terraform version for stability

Used cost-effective Free Tier AWS instances

Removed old EC2 + Elastic IP setup after migration to ECS

Application successfully served via Load Balancer DNS
