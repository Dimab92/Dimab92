## Virtualization and Bash:

Hypervisors: VirtualBox (installation and configuration)

Installed and configured a UNIX OS on a virtual machine

Performed system update and upgrade via command line

Installed and configured all necessary tools for server operation

## Bash Scripting:
Developed Bash scripts to automate cloning of GitHub repositories via SSH

Created versioned .tar.gz backups with dynamic filename generation (version_1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.)

Implemented logic for version incrementing, backup retention (--max-backups), and batch execution (--max-runs)

Used jq to create and update versions.json tracking backup metadata (version, size, date)

Managed file operations (compression, deletion, creation) entirely through Bash

## Docker and Containerization:
Authored Dockerfile to containerize the backup script, enabling consistent execution environments.

Ensured secure handling of sensitive data through Docker volumes and environment variables.

Configured container to persist backup files to the host system using mounted volumes.
