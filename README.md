## Virtualization and Bash:
Hypervisors: VirtualBox (installation and configuration)

Installed and configured a UNIX OS on a virtual machine

Performed system update and upgrade via command line

Installed and configured all necessary tools for server operation

## Bash Scripting:
Writing Bash scripts to automate daily tasks and make work easier.

Created one script that:

Clones GitHub repository using SSH

Makes compressed backup files with version numbers

Tracks backup info in a JSON file using jq

Deletes old backups if needed

Can run many backups in one go

## Docker and Containerization:
Wrote a Dockerfile to run the backup script inside a container

Used Docker volumes to keep backup files safe and outside the container

Used environment variables to protect sensitive data

Backups are saved to the host system so they are not lost when the container stops
